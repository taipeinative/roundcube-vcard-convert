# Roundcube Webmail Contacts File Fix
This program aims to convert contacts file generated by [Roundcube Webmail](https://roundcube.net/) into vCard 3.0 standard format.

## Features

* Place `X-DEPARTMENT:` (Organizational Unit #1 Name) and `TITLE:` (Organizational Unit #2 Name) properties at the back of `ORG:`
* Add `ROLE:` () according to `TITLE:` if there are none.<sup>[1]</sup>
* Add `REV:` (Timestamp) at the end of each vCards.

[1]: Although there are special notes in RFC 6350,
> *This property is based on the X.520 Business Category explanatory attribute &lsqb;[CCITT.X520.1988](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6350#ref-CCITT.X520.1988)&rsqb;. This property is included as an organizational type to avoid confusion with the semantics of the TITLE property and incorrect usage of that property when the semantics of this property is intended,*

it seems meaningless since programs like Apple Contacts treat them as same field.
